## Research

My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic, topological and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems.

In the experimentally-driven work, we studied the magnetic phase diagram of the model of the topological insulator MnBi2Te4 using the classical Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the competing interactions, the phase diagram of MnBi2Te4 showed the proximity to various magnetic phases, including a prediction of a skyrmion-like phase.

#### [2] Three-state Potts nematic order in continuous models with mixed interactions

We extended the concept of the stabilization of the long-range nematic order from Z3 Potts universality class to continuous models on stacked lattice designs and to yet unexplored regime of materials with mixed ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. We studied the zero- and finite-temperature phase diagrams and the criticality of the Z3 Potts phase that emerges through a composite order parameter and explored the role of quantum and thermal fluctuations on stabilizing the Z3 Potts phase in the purely bilinear Heisenberg model.

#### [3] Itinerant magnetic frustration in a multiorbital model for SrCo2As2

We revisited the intriguing magnetic behavior of SrCo2As2, which remains paramagnetic despite the observed strong magnetic fluctuations. We identify the leading magnetic instabilities and study how different parameters can exchange the relative strengths between them. We introduce the frustration parameter as a difference between the critical Hubbard interaction strenths for different orders and argue the lack of magnetic order in SrCo2As2 due to the itinerant magentic frustration.
