[1] In the experimentally-driven work, we studied the magnetic phase diagram of the model of the topological insulator MnBi2Te4 using the classical Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the competing interactions, the phase diagram of MnBi2Te4 showed the proximity to various magnetic phases, including a prediction of a skyrmion-like phase.

[2] We extended the concept of the stabilization of the long-range nematic order from Z3 Potts universality class to multiple stacked lattice model designs and to yet unexplored regime of materials with mixed ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions in the models with SO(3) symmetry. We studied the zero- and finite-temperature phase diagrams and the criticality of the Z3 Potts phase that emerges through a composite order parameter and explored the role of quantum and thermal fluctuations on stabilizing the Z3 Potts phase in the purely bilinear Heisenberg model.
