## About

I'm a PhD student at Iowa State University in condensed matter physics working in the field of strongly correlated quantum materials in the group <a href="https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/porth/">Prof. Peter P. Orth. My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems.
