## About

Using the combination of analytical and numerical tools and with the experience in collaborating with multiple experimental groups, I study quantum many-body systems and correlation-driven physics in electron systems. My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic, topological and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems.

#### [1] Magnetic phase diagram of the topological insulator MnBi2Te4

<img src="images/phases_MnBi2Te4.PNG?raw=true"/>
In the experimentally-driven work, we studied the magnetic phase diagram of the model of the topological insulator MnBi2Te4 using the classical Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the competing interactions, the phase diagram of MnBi2Te4 showed the proximity to various magnetic phases, including a prediction of a skyrmion-like phase.

#### [2] Three-state Potts nematic order in continuous stacked models

<img src="images/models_PottsZ3.PNG?raw=true"/>
We extended the concept of the stabilization of the long-range nematic order from Z3 Potts universality class to continuous models on stacked lattice designs and to yet unexplored regime of materials with mixed ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. We studied the zero- and finite-temperature phase diagrams and the criticality of the Z3 Potts phase that emerges through a composite order parameter and explored the role of quantum and thermal fluctuations on stabilizing the Z3 Potts phase in the purely bilinear Heisenberg model.

#### [3] Itinerant magnetic frustration in a multiorbital model for SrCo2As2

We revisited the intriguing magnetic behavior of SrCo2As2, which remains paramagnetic despite the observed strong magnetic fluctuations and identified the leading magnetic instabilities. We studied how different parameters can exchange the relative strengths between them. Introducing the frustration parameter as a difference between the critical Hubbard interaction strenths for different orders, we argued the lack of magnetic order in SrCo2As2 due to the itinerant magentic frustration.

#### [4] Nonlinear optical responses in van der Waals materials
Lately, are trying to unravel the origin of the observed gigantic resonant peaks in the nonlinear optical responses of the van der Waals materials from the BiTeX family (X=Cr, Br, I). We calculated tensors of nonlinear optical responses from the realistic bandstructures obtained from the first-principles, where we particularly identify the contribution from the quantum geometry quantities like metric, connection and curvature.

#### [5] Interplay of magnetism and topology in axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2 in a magnetic field

The axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2 exhibits a broken-helix magnetic ground state [S. X. M. Riberolles et al., Nature communications, <b>12</b>(1), 1-7. (2021)] that breaks inversion but respects the product of twofold-rotation and time-reversal (2’) symmetry, which is predicted to lead to exotic protected gapless surface states on select crystal faces. Motivated by the recent neutron scattering experiments that report a complex magnetic behavior in an external magnetic field, we design and study a minimal symmetry-constrained spin model that exhibits a broken-helix ground stateg and study the intriguing possibility of symmetry-protected gapless modes located at internal domain wall boundaries in the material.
