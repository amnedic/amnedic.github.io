## About

I am a Ph.D. student in theoretical condensed matter physics with analytical and numerical skills, working in the field of strongly correlated quantum materials in the group of <a href="https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/porth/">Prof. Peter P. Orth</a> at Iowa State University, Ames. My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems.
