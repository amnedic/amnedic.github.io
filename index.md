## About

The novel ways to interact with the quantum nature of matter challenge us to ask new type of questions that only recently became physically relevant and to think of the ways how to stimulate the revelation of quantum effects on larger scales.

Using the combination of analytical and numerical tools and with the experience in collaborating with multiple experimental groups I study quantum materials and the role of interactions in the emergent macroscopic phenomena in correlated electron systems. My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems. I have experience in studying magnetism, criticality, and non-linear optical responses in models of real materials.
