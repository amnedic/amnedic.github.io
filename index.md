## About

Using the combination of analytical and numerical tools and with the experience in collaborating with multiple experimental groups, I study quantum many-body systems and correlation-driven physics in electron systems. My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic, topological and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems.

## Projects

* In the experimentally-driven work, I studied the magnetic phase diagram of the experimentally-derived model of the topological insulator MnBi2Te4 using the classical Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the competing interactions, the phase diagram of MnBi2Te4 showed the proximity to various magnetic phases, including a prediction of a skyrmion-like phase.
