## About

Using the combination of analytical and numerical tools and with the experience in collaborating with multiple experimental groups, I study quantum many-body systems and correlation-driven physics in electron systems. My research is motivated by the intriguing magnetic, topological and optical phenomena observed in prospective two- and three-dimensional electron systems.
